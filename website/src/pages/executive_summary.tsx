          instruction tuning processes, with most models now having an instruction following rate 
          of higher than 75%.</p>,

           models on tasks that involve reasoning over long-context shows significant performance 
           drops as context size grows. Amongst all models, GPT-4o 2024-05-13 and Llama 3.1 405B 
           have the lowest drop in performance for longer context.</p>,

          and information irrelevance rates of higher than 20% (potentially fabricated information). 
          Llama 3.1 405B, GPT-4o 2024-05-13, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet are the best performing models in

          others (Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus, and Llama 3.1 405B) exhibit low 
          accuracy in classifying toxic content and a high amount of refusal. During the safe language 
          generation evaluation, models like GPT-4 1106 Preview and Mistral Large 2407 have the highest 
          toxicity rates. GPT-4o 2024-05-13 is the only model that has both a high toxicity detection 
          accuracy and a low toxicity score for safe language generation, as shown in the discriminative 
          and generative evaluations respectively. </p>,

          language-only, the performance of most tested models is higher for the language-only condition. 
          GPT-4o is the only model that consistently achieves better results when presented with both 
          vision and language information, showing therefore that it can better fuse the two data modalities.</p>,

          performance in multimodal question answering (MMMU). In tasks like object recognition and visual prompting, 
          the performance of Claude 3.5 Sonnet is better or comparable to GPT-4o 2024-05-13, but Gemini 1.5 Pro
