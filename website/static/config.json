Model training pipelines now often include a dedicated instruction tuning phase for specifically teaching models to follow complex instructions for real-world scenarios.Consequently, evaluating how well models follow such instructions is crucial when assessing overall model behaviour. While real instructions provided by users can be very varied and complex, a predominant category are instructions to control the format or style of the output. IFEval is a benchmark designed to evaluate a model's ability to follow instructions about the output style, structure and form. Recent model evaluations report ~70-80% accuracy on IFEval on average, showing headroom for further analysis and progress on challenging instruction categories.",

Kitab consists of book-related data across more than 600 authors and 13,000 queries with varying number of constraints and complexity. In each query in the dataset, the first constraint is always fixed to an author and the following can vary among the following types of book constraints to test for different constraint satisfaction capabilities: lexical, named entity, temporal. If the model fails to satisfy the constraints, this can lead to information fabrication and hallucinations (i.e., book titles that do not exist), factual mistakes (i.e., book titles that are not from the author or that do not satisfy the constraints given by the user), grounding failures (i.e., inability to extract and parse information presented in context).",

At its core, the main question is whether it is possible to extract reliable factual knowledge from a model and whether it is possible to ground the model's answers in given context. Previous work has studied factuality by measuring model accuracy for questions whose output is expected to be single, often atomic facts or otherwise single facts that require multi-hop reasoning. However, given the generative nature of current models, a more compelling and contemporary scenario is the one where users form queries that expect a longer output with a list of items that satisfy the criteria behind what they are looking for (e.g., \"a list of ice cream shops in San Diego\").
