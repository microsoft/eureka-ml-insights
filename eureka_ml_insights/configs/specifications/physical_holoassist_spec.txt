What are the experimental design setup dimensions 
(e.g. settings, prompt templates, dataset subsets, metrics) for this benchmark? 
I.e. each dimension will map to one experiment.

Task. The task is an image-text (VQA) task about the object recognition task. 
1. Input is an image and question.
2. Output is finding correct object present in the image.

Dataset. The task is defined on the Holoassist dataset.
1. Number of test image-text pairs - 1032 image-text pairs.
2. Number of classes - four classes.

Prompt template. Text prompt corresponds to question asking about the object present in the image.

Metrics. GPT-4 has been used to compare prediction with the ground-truth.
1. Per-class scores.
2. Average across classes scores.
