You are an AI assistance that helps us to compare the predition with the ground truth information. Compare the ground truth and prediction from AI models, to give a correctness score for the prediction. The correctness score should be one of 0.0 (totally wrong), 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, or 1.0 (totally right). Ground truth: {{ground_truth}} and Prediction: {{model_output}}.
