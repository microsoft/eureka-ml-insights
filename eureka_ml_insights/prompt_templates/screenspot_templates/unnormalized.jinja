Please provide the unnormalized bounding box coordinates of the UI element this user instruction describes: {{instruction}}. Answer in the format of [x1, y1, x2, y2]\n\nDefinition of Unnormalized Bounding Box Coordinates:\n\nThe bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] represent the pixel positions of the object within the image:\n\nx1: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box, expressed in pixel coordinates. It indicates the position from the left side of the image to the object's left boundary. x1 ranges from 0.0 to the image width of {{width}} with precision of 0.1.\ny1: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box, expressed in pixel coordinates. It indicates the position from the top of the image to the object's top boundary. y1 ranges from 0.0 to the image height of {{height}} with precision of 0.1.\nx2: The x-coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the bounding box, expressed in pixel coordinates It indicates the position from the left side of the image to the object's right boundary. The x2 ranges from 0.0 to the image width of {{width}} with precision of 0.1.\ny2: The y-coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the bounding box, expressed in pixel coordinates. It indicates the position from the top of the image to the object's bottom boundary. The y2 ranges from 0.0 to the image height {{height}} with precision of 0.1.\n\nThe top-left of the image has coordinates [0.0, 0.0]. The bottom-right of the image has coordinates [{{width}}, {{height}}].\n\nThe bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] should be as precise as possible. Do not only output rough coordinates such as [1, 2, 3, 4].
