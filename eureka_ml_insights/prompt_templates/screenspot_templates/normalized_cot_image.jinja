Please provide the normalized bounding box coordinates of the UI element this user instruction describes: {{instruction}}. 

Definition of Normalized Bounding Box Coordinates:

The bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] represent the normalized positions of the object within the image:

x1: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box, expressed as a percentage of the image width. It indicates the position from the left side of the image to the object's left boundary. x1 ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 with precision of 0.01.

y1: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box, expressed as a percentage of the image height. It indicates the position from the top of the image to the object's top boundary. y1 ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 with precision of 0.01.

x2: The x-coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the bounding box, expressed as a percentage of the image width. It indicates the position from the left side of the image to the object's right boundary. The x2 ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 with precision of 0.01.

y2: The y-coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the bounding box, expressed as a percentage of the image height. It indicates the position from the top of the image to the object's bottom boundary. The y2 ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 with precision of 0.01.

The top-left of the image has coordinates [0.00, 0.00]. The bottom-right of the image has coordinates [1.00, 1.00].

The bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] should be as precise as possible. Do not only output rough coordinates such as [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4].

Let's think step by step:

1) First give a detailed description of the image.  In particular create alt text, image descriptions, image transcriptions, and object descrptions:

Alt Text: A brief, context-driven description of the image. Your focus will be on the most essential aspects of the image, avoiding redundancy or overly technical language. Do not start with “This image,” “The image,” “Image of,” or “Picture of,” just start describing the image. But do specify if it’s a logo, illustration, math diagram, or computer or mobile screenshot, or painting. 

Image Description: A detailed text description of the image, several paragraphs long if needed. You will expand on the details, offering context and clarity. Work from general to specific, and provide an overview before describing any details. For charts or graphs, include details about axes, labels, and trends.  For photos describe describe the emotional tone of the image (e.g., peaceful, chaotic, joyful, eerie, etc. Ensure the description is clear, logical, and does not contain overly complex terminology unless required by the context.

Image Transcript: Transcribe any visible text from the image, in reading order (top to bottom, left to right). I would like you to accurately convert the image text into a readable plain text format, ensuring the transcription is clear and accessible. Note the positioning of text and its relationship to other text blocks if relevant. If an image does not contain text, please omit the transcription task and focus solely on alt-text and descriptions.

Object Breakdown: For each distinct object type in the image, provide: Object Type, Number of Instances, Color(s), Size category (small / medium / large — relative to image context), Normalized Bounding Box Coodinates in the format [label: [x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max]

Deliver each component—alt text, image description, image transcription, and obejct breakdown as distinct sections and enclose all of them in a block delimited as <image_interp></image_interp>.

2) Then think through and provide your answer in the following format:

Reasoning: <reasoning>

Final Answer: In the format of [x1, y1, x2, y2]
