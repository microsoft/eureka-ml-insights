Please provide the bounding box coordinate of the UI element this user instruction describes: {{instruction}}. Answer in the format of [x1, y1, x2, y2]\n\nDefinition of Bounding Box Coordinates:\n\nThe bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] represent the normalized positions of the object within the image:\n\nx1: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box, expressed as a percentage of the image width. It indicates the position from the left side of the image to the object's left boundary. x1 ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 with precision of 0.01.\ny1: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the bounding box, expressed as a percentage of the image height. It indicates the position from the top of the image to the object's top boundary. y1 ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 with precision of 0.01.\nx2: The x-coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the bounding box, expressed as a percentage of the image width. It indicates the position from the left side of the image to the object's right boundary. The x2 ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 with precision of 0.01.\ny2: The y-coordinate of the bottom-right corner of the bounding box, expressed as a percentage of the image height. It indicates the position from the top of the image to the object's bottom boundary. The y2 ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 with precision of 0.01.\n\nThe top-left of the image has coordinates [0.00, 0.00]. The bottom-right of the image has coordinates [1.00, 1.00].\n\nThe bounding box coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] should be as precise as possible. Do not only output rough coordinates such as [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4].
