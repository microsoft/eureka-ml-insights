You are given clauses of a 3-SAT problem. Check if there exists a satisfying assignment.

Reflect on what the problem is asking. Think step by step and explain your reasoning in detail.
If a satisfying assignment exists, provide the assignments wrapped by final_answer tag: like <final_answer>{'Solution': 'v_1, v_2, ...'}</final_answer>. Here each v_i is True or False depending on the assignment.
If no satisfying assignment exists, provide the assignments wrapped by final_answer tag: like <final_answer>{'Solution': 'Unsatisfiable'}</final_answer>. 

For example, <final_answer>{'Solution': 'True, False, ...'}</final_answer> is a valid answer.
