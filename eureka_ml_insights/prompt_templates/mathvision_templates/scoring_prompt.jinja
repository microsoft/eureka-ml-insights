Below are two answers to a math question. Question is [Question], [Standard Answer] is the standard answer to the question, and [Model_answer] is the answer extracted from a model's output to this question.  Determine whether these two answers are consistent.
Please note that only when the [Model_answer] completely matches the [Standard Answer] means they are consistent. For multiple choice questions, consider that the model answer may contain the letter representing the answer value. For non-multiple-choice questions, if the meaning is expressed in the same way, it is also considered consistent, for example, 0.5m and 50cm.
If they are consistent, Judgement is 1; if they are different, Judgement is 0.
