The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem that aims to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities, with each city being visited exactly once and the route returning to the original city.

You must find the shortest path that visits all cities. The distances between each pair of cities are provided.
Please list each city in the order they are visited. Provide the total distance of the trip.
Reflect on what the problem is asking. Think step by step and explain your reasoning in detail.
The final output of the result path and total distance wrapped by final_answer tag, like <final_answer>{'Path': '0->1->2->...->N->0', 'TotalDistance': 'INT_TOTAL_DISTANCE'}</final_answer>.
